### Hi there, I'm Daniela! 👋

I am a Web Developer based in Sweden and recently graduated from [Technigo](https://www.technigo.io/program) bootcamp this summer 2020. 😎 🇸🇪
 
- ✨  My favorite stack includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS and Styled Components 
- 🍀  My goals for 2020: to find my first job as a web developer! 
- 💪🏻  I am a career shifter: I worked for 13 years in the cultural sector in areas such as Project Management, administrations and communication, therefore I can contribute         with a good mixture of planning, structure, productivity, creativity and problem solving.
