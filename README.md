### Hi there, I'm Daniela! 👋

I am a Web Developer based in Sweden and graduated from [Technigo](https://www.technigo.io/program) bootcamp this summer 2020. 😎 🇸🇪
 
- 🍀  My goal for 2020: to find my first job as a web developer! 
- ✨  My favorite stack includes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, APIs and Styled Components 
- 💪🏻  I am a career shifter: I worked for 13 years in the cultural sector in areas such as project management, administration and communication, therefore I can contribute           with a good mixture of planning, structure, productivity, creativity and problem solving. 
- 🧚🏼‍♀️  I look forward to collaborate with companies and projects that make a difference in society and people's life.
